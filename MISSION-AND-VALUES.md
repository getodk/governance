# Mission and Values

The ODK community produces free and open-source software for collecting, managing, and using data in resource-constrained environments.

We value open communities and open source.

* We work to build a global community where contributors of all backgrounds, talents, and skills can come together to create and use great software.
* We discuss, decide, and develop in the open, using publicly accessible tools and consensus-based processes.
* We share our work under permissive, non-restrictive licenses so that anyone can use, modify, build on, or distribute that work to solve their own problems.

We are user-focused and deployment-centric.

* We care deeply about users in resource-constrained environments, regardless of domain.
* We serve users with a wide range of technical ability and organizations with a wide range of technical capacity.
* We believe users should have ownership of their data and the flexibility to select suitable components from an ecosystem of complementary tools.
* We value an iterative design process and strive for simplicity, clarity, and robustness in the artifacts we create.
